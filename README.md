# Automated testing of guizero applications

This is the code for my talk to the Raspberry Pint group on 26 April 2022.

It's an implementation of Noughts and Crosses (US: tic-tac-toe) using the brilliant `guizero` library.

It contains an automated test which drives the GUI.

The game code is adapted from the example in [Create Graphical User Interfaces in Python](https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/books/create-guis)

## To Install:

In a directory fo your choice,
```git clone ```

## To run:

### The game

```python3 tictactoe.py```

### The test

```python3 ```
